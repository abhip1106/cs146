Let's compare some basic math functions to refresh our memory. For each of the following, just write which function is asymptotically greater (So, you should be thinking about your asymptotic notations!). Show your reasoning for the same.

10000000000n^2 < n^3
simplify 10000000000 = n
so the lhs is constant time and the rhs is linear
As we approach infinity the asymptote for n3 is bigger

n^2 log(n) vs n(log(n))^10 simplify
n^2log(n) is greater


n^logn vs 2^(sqrt(n))


 2n vs 2^(2n)
 2^(2n) the exponent grows faster

Is Prime time complexity
 1. Best Case: Number is a multiple of 2
 O(1)

 2. Worst Case:  Number is Prime
 Theta(sqrt(n))

 3. Average Case: Number is Composite
O(sqrt(n))
